# News Article App

## Description
This small app utilizes the Google News API to pull down the 10 most relevant articles on a given day, then asks the user if they would like to favorite any of them. If a user does, the articles will be added and stored to a favorites table. The user can delete favorites, add favorites, see their favorites, the most favorited article of the day, and the sources for the available articles.

## Installation
Fork and clone the repo, and then run the 'bin/run.rb' file.

## Example
Enter numbers to navigate the menu.

```ruby
=================================================================================================================================
Is there anything else you would like to do today? Enter the corresponding number to continue. Enter 'done' if you're done:
1. Show me my favorites
2. Delete a favorite
3. Show me today's articles again
4. Add another favorite
5. See the most trending article today
6. See the sources for the available articles
7. See other users who marked some of their favorites
(input) Show me my favorites
=================================================================================================================================

That is not a valid input! Choose from 1-7 or enter 'done'
=================================================================================================================================
```
